# octi

### Hi Mr.Gerwing,
Here is the Final Assesment, just some pre-requisites:
BEFORE RUNNING THE APP MAKE SURE
 - In Windows display settings you have the scale set to 125%
 - You run the app in fullscreen
 - Don't have too many thigns open becasuse Flutter isn't too efficient with a debug app but is a lot better with built apps
 - If you run into performance issues, it might be worthwhile to build the app just type "flutter build" in the root of the octi directory and it will spit out an executable ;)
 - If you run into any problems, contact Shayan or follow a troubleshoot guide

## DETAILS:
sidebar.dart and main.dart are commented (around 50 lines each)
Flowchart is on ####.dart
Pseudocode is on ####.dart

Thanks and have a great holidays!
Shayan
